# SpotToBeat

## I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS APP FOR ACTUAL USAGE
Please use something like [BeatSaverMatcher](https://github.com/patagonaa/BeatSaverMatcher) or any other alternative on Google if you are looking for a converter.

A console app to convert songs from a Spotify playlist, and download the corresponding beatsaber map from [beatsaver](https://beatsaver.com).

This project uses [BeatSaverSharper](https://github.com/Auros/BeatSaverSharper) and [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET).

## Installation 

- If you want to try this out, you must build from source (unless I have decided to add something to GitHub releases). 

- The project requires a Spotify developer app, and its client ID and client secret.

- You will require a file called appsettings.json, in whichever folder the executable is within.

- The file must formatted as such: {"ClientID":"","ClientSecret":"","AccessToken":"", RefreshToken:""} (Fill in ClientID and ClientSecret).
